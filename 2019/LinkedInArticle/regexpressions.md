I knew, the use of regular expressions are playing a vast role in the field of development including some of the important tasks like 

+ validation of value in input fields (using JavaScript etc.)

+ server side data validation (using Python, Golang, Node.js etc.)

+ pattern matching, search & replacement kind of works

Some of the applications can be seen easily in many places like 

+ when you define URL patterns (Python, Node.js, Golang etc.)

+ Querying database (MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Oracle etc.)

I thought to write this post to present some of the important examples related to Python's re module. 
Most of you will be already familiar with it.
