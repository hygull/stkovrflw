1) :ear_of_rice:Sometimes you will be in the trouble and someone will help you,
 :seedling: Things may get better, we don't know, no more reasons, just a few.

2) :raised_hands:Sometimes you dream in the night and forget when you wake up,
  :ear_of_rice:May be they were good or bad but they existed like a makeup.

3) ðŸŽ—Sometimes after knowing responsibilities also we try to become reckless,
  â˜„Everything is important, you know? Not only time, money, life or necklace.

4) :ear_of_rice:Sometimes we get panicked after knowing about little issues,
  :raised_hands:Why don't we try to think to combine cells & make tissues?

5) ðŸ•ŠSometimes we think big after motivation but suddenly we forget,
  :ear_of_rice:It's because of the reasons you know? No dream, no goal & target.
