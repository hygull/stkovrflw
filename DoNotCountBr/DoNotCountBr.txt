I have a string consist of "br" an "nbsp;" tags , what i need is that i need to have limit the character to 100, which means only 100 characters should show, since each "br" takes 4 characters instead of 100 i am getting 108, to getting below output i can do it in a single line

data.substr(0,100) 
output =>

it to make a type specimen book. 

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap

but it includes br tag i dont want to remove br and nbsp; but don't count that

expected output =>

it to make a type specimen book. 

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into ele

i have done some snippet, but it gives the count of 108
