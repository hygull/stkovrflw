**Markdown** gets converted into **HTML**/**XHMTL**.

> **John Gruber** created the **Markdown language** in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax, with the goal of enabling people to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert it to structurally valid **HTML** (or **XHTML**).

**HTML** is completely based on using **&nbsp;** for adding extra spaces if it doesn't externally define/use **JavaScript** or **CSS** for elements. 

>**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to **HTML** and many other formats using a tool by the same name.

If you want to use &raquo;

### only one space
Either use `&npsp;` or just hit `Spacebar` (2nd one is good choice in this case)

### more than one space 
`&nbsp;`+<kbd>space</kbd> (for 2 consecutive spaces)

eg. If you want to add 10 spaces contiguously then you should use

`&npsp; &nbsp; &npsp; &nbsp; &npsp;`
> `&npsp;`<kbd>space</kbd>`&nbsp;`<kbd>space</kbd>`&npsp;`<kbd>space</kbd>`&nbsp;`<kbd>space</kbd>`&nbsp;`<kbd>space</kbd>

instead of using 10 `&nbsp;` one after one as the below one

`&npsp;&nbsp;&npsp;&nbsp;&npsp;&npsp;&nbsp;&npsp;&nbsp;&npsp;`
